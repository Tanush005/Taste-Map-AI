# 🍽️ TasteMap AI

**TasteMap AI** is an intelligent, conversational restaurant discovery platform designed to provide highly personalized dining recommendations. It goes far beyond simple keyword matching by understanding user **intent**, **context**, **vibe**, and **dietary needs** through natural language queries.

Built with production-grade software engineering principles, this project demonstrates full-stack development, performance optimization, and AI integration using **Google Gemini**.
